Notes and examples of python packages that interest me.

My inspiration is the book "[Windows 95 WIN 32 programming API bible](https://archive.org/details/windows95win32pr00simo) and Sun's original Java documention which you could read and understand any API function by reading the description and example program. The example was as simple as possible to demonstrate the APU and shared over as many accompying API functions that were required to set it up.

See the page template for details on the format.
